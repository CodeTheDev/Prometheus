# Prometheus ![language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Java-orange.svg)
I have made a Discord bot progammed in Java utilizing JDA by DV8FromTheWorld and LavaPlayer by sedmelluq. The JDA library is the core of the bot, it has lots of built-in functions that make it easier to utilize the Discord API in Java. The LavaPlayer library will be handling all of the audio related aspects of the bot. 

This bot will have some moderation commands (kick, ban, mute, clear, logs), fun commands (coinflip, diceroll, calculator), audio commands (join, disconnect, play, pause, stop, skip, volume) and other miscellaneous commands (sudo, ping, poll, help).

The development of this bot is currently ongoing. More features soon to come!
